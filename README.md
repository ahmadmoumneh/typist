# Typist

Application written in ReactJS that teaches a user to type fast using his or her 10 fingers. It uses a virtual color-coded keyboard which shows you where to put your finger while you read and type from a text pane that has auto-scrolling.

A user can choose a prepared text from the selection or add his or her custom text to practice. He or she can start the word-per-minute measurement tool that measures the typing speed as well as the accuracy and errors committed.
